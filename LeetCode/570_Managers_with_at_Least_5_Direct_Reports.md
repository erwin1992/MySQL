# Problem

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out managers with at least 5 direct report. For the above table, your SQL query should return:


# Create Table
```sql
Create table If Not Exists Employee (Id int, Name varchar(255), Department varchar(255), ManagerId int);
Truncate table Employee;
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('101', 'John', 'A', null);
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('102', 'Dan', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('103', 'James', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('104', 'Amy', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('105', 'Anne', 'A', '101');
insert into Employee (Id, Name, Department, ManagerId) values ('106', 'Ron', 'B', '101');
```

# Solution

Logic: select managers' ID by aggregate function. 

```sql
SELECT
    Name
FROM
    Employee AS t1 JOIN
    (SELECT
        ManagerId
    FROM
        Employee
    GROUP BY ManagerId
    HAVING COUNT(ManagerId) >= 5) AS t2
    ON t1.Id = t2.ManagerId
```
